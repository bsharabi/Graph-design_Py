**Graph design** - is an software tool for directed and undirected graphs. 
it gives the user the ability to see the graph visually, get information about the graph and analyze it.
all the information based on many algorithms and calculations simple and complicated together to give the best complexity possible.
Graph design gives Graph theory students a new way to study and understand interacted graphs faster simpler and get productive.

## Algo:
* >this is the core class of Graph design. it contains multiple algorithms based on well known Graph theory algorithms like Dijkstra DFS and many more, the main method of this class is to disassemble those algorithms to smaller function in way they can use each other's information and sync with each other, what make Graph Design better quicker and simpler. the whole class outputs is based on the same results format so each function can help multiple answers for different user requests. the main algorithms are:

### Dijakstra: 
* > it based on Dijkstra’s algorithm but uses a better DFS to initialize the vertex weight's use a priority que to make sure it always takes the shortest way.

### TCP:
* > another greedy based algorithm who use "Tsp" obj to hold a list of node that contains the shortest path between two nodes,and a distance represented as double, for each Node we create a Priority que of "Tsp" each one for a different "city", so it "actually" create a new Graph only with the city’s we want to visit while the other Nodes connects them are represented in the weight of the shortest distance between them.
